Project | Purpose
:-----|:------
Digitabulum | Sensor front-end PCB
[r2-Backplane](r2-Backplane) | A backplane PCB containing the power-management block and associated support circuits.
[PowerPlant-Module](PowerPlant-Module) | Digitabulum's power-management block implemented as a stand-alone breadboard module.
[r2-Harness](r2-Harness) | A debugging and development tool. It adapts a Digitabulum board to a standard breadboard. It is also useful as a template for a custom backplane.
[Compute-Template](Compute-Template) | A debugging and development tool. Provides a breakout to the compute/comm PCB connector on the r2-Backplane. It is also useful as a template for a custom Compute PCB.
