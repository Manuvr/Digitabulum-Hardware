## KiCAD Projects in this repo


Project | Purpose
:-----|:------
Digitabulum-r2 | Sensor front-end PCB. (Pending release)
r2-Metacarpals | Flex circuit for the metacarpals. (Pending release)
r2-Digit | Flex circuit for digits. (Pending release)
[r2-Backplane](r2-Backplane) | A backplane PCB containing the power-management block and associated support circuits.
[Compute-WROOM32](Compute-WROOM32) | A digitabulum compute PCB based on Espressif's WROOM32 module.
[PowerPlant-Module](PowerPlant-Module) | Digitabulum's power-management block implemented as a stand-alone breadboard module.
[r2-Harness](r2-Harness) | A debugging and development tool. It adapts a Digitabulum board to a standard breadboard. It is also useful as a template for a custom backplane.
Digit-Harness | A debugging and development tool. It adapts Digitabulum flex circuits to a standard breadboard. (Pending release)
[Compute-Template](Compute-Template) | A debugging and development tool. Provides a breakout to the compute/comm PCB connector on the r2-Backplane. It is also useful as a template for a custom Compute PCB.
